/**
 * Represents an employee in an organisation
 * Normal employees have initials and a role (and could have further information)
 * All employees (other than the CEO) have a manager, who is another employee
 * Any employee who is a manager will have a set of employees in their team.
 *  (If an employee has an empty team, then they aren't a manager.)
 * An employee object can also represent a vacant position in the organisation
 *  (a kind of "virtual employee"), represented by an employee with no name or role.
 *  A vacant position still has a manager and may have a team of employees under it.
 *  When a vacant position is filled, the initials and role will be filled in, turning
 *  the employee object into a regular employee.
 *
 * An employee is drawn as a rectangle containing their initials and role.
 * Every employee (except the CEO) will be drawn with a link to their manager.
 * The position where a team member of a manager is drawn is one layer down
 *  from the manager, at a horizontal position specified by
 *  the employee's offset - how far to the right (or left) of the manager.
 *  This means that if the manager is moved around on the screen, the team
 *  members (and their team members, and ....) will automatically move with them.
