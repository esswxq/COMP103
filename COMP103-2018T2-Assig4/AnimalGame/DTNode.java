 * A Decision Tree is a structure for getting to an answer by following
 * through a tree of yes/no questions.
 * Each internal node has a question and two children.
 * - the Yes child is the decision tree to follow if the answer to the question is yes
 * - the No child is the decision tree to follow if the answer to the question is no
 * Leaves of the tree do not have a question, but have an Answer.
 *  They should not have any children.
 * A leaf node can be turned into an internal node by giving it a question and two children.
